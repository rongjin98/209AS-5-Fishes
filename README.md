Wee2: Value Iteration/Policy Iteration
Run week2/main.py to get the full simulation result

Week3: Double Agents Function Approximation & Value Iteration
Run week3/two_agents_visualizer.py for simulation results

-Saved_data is used for Week3 only, which consists of different matrices generated by function approximaiton and value iteration.

-It only serves for facilitating computational time.

-One can update saved_data, by running double_agents_function_approximation.py and double_agents_transition_prob.py

Week6: Localization using Bayes Filter
Run week6/main.py
